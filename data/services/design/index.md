![UX Design](./web-design.png 'UX Design by Jeff Cagle')

## All great applications begin with great designs.

I have dedicated over 15 years to mastering industry design tools such as [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html 'Adobe Photoshop'), [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html 'Adobe XD'), and now [Figma](https://www.figma.com/ 'Figma').

Step one to creating beautiful interfaces is designing mockups and/or interactive prototypes using design software. From these designs, ideas and solutions are developed to promote the best user experience.

In addition to user interface design, my skills expanded into high-end retouching, photo manipulation, color correction, and color grading.

I've developed a professional eye for image processing and color using tools such as [Capture One](https://www.captureone.com/en 'Capture One') and [Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html 'Adobe Lightroom'). This has become invaluable for developing brand color harmonies, theming, and color matching for digital media.
