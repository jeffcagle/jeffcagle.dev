## All great applications begin with great designs.

Design is about much more than just making something pretty. A polished design should be fast, uncluttered, with high-quality graphics and media.

Potential code challenges should be considered, encouraging modularity and scalability for rapid development. In essence, designs should be thoughtful, reactive and engaging, and promote a positive user experience.

This, of course, is the objective.

For the past 15 years, I have focused my efforts on mastering industry design tools such as [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html 'Adobe Photoshop'), [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html 'Adobe XD'), and now [Figma](https://www.figma.com/ 'Figma'). My proficiency allows me to focus on design requirements without being distracted by software complexities or limitations.

## Color

**_Colors matter._** Each one can invoke a different reaction. How colors relate to each other can also conjure up a subconscious response.

Fortunately, I have a background in photography and photo manipulation, where I've been able to cultivate a strong grasp of color theory. This insight is invaluable for producing pleasing color harmonies, develop branding, or creating new graphics.

Through my image processing experience, I have developed a professional eye using tools such as [Capture One](https://www.captureone.com/en 'Capture One') and [Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html 'Adobe Lightroom').
