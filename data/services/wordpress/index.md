There was a time when deploying a WordPress application was a cumbersome process utilizing FTP. Luckily, it's possible to modernize this experience, while still enjoying the familiarity of the WordPress CMS.

Having been a WordPress developer since its inception, I have faced a wide assortment of unique challenges.

## WordPress Environments

I often use the [Trellis](https://roots.io/trellis/ 'Trellis') LEMP stack, which deploys via Git repositories and handles server provisioning with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/ 'Ansible'). This makes spinning up a new local instance of the web server fast and easy. It also enables the setup of staging and testing servers, and works well for team development.

Another good option is to use the WordPress API and set up a headless CMS. Content teams who are already familiar with WordPress can manage content via the WordPress Admin, even though the website is built in another frontend framework, like [React](https://reactjs.org/ 'React'). This method means you won't be locked into the WordPress ecosystem and plugins. Migrating content from one CMS to another, or changing frontend frameworks, becomes much simpler.

## Customization

All my WordPress apps are built with a focus on reusable components, which helps facilitate faster future development and scalability. I also use the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/ 'Advanced Custom Fields') API to create custom backend templates, which means content creators can focus more on content, and less on layout.

The mileage I have acquired over the years has helped me develop a good system for building modern WordPress applications. And it seems, at least for now, that WordPress isn't going away any time soon.
