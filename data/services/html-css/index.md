## How fast is fast?

This bar always seems to be moving. What was once considered speedy, would be unacceptable today. And with the persistent rise in mobile traffic, the need for performant HTML and CSS just grows stronger.

It seems a new framework or library is released every week to address these modern challenges - [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/ 'Tailwind'), [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/ 'Styled Components'), [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/ 'Emotion'), and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/ 'Sass')... just to name a few. Then there are the "old school" libraries which remain relevant, such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ 'Bootstrap').

But this endless list of new tools means frontend devs must constantly be learning. Love it or hate it, there is no rest for the modern developer.

Fortunately, **I love it**.

## My Skills

With well over a decade of HTML & CSS experience, I've become somewhat of a guru. With a focus on mobile-first styling and animations, I've learned to develop fast and reliable applications for clients around the world.
