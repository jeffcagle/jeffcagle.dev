![Custom Exercise Metrics](./exercise.png 'Custom Exercise Metrics')

They always say, **"Build an app _YOU_ want to use."** Well, I wanted a better way to track my fitness gains... and losses.

I wanted something that presented my workout data clearly, and charted progress over time. I wanted to be able to have workout routines to organize my exercises and discover which routines worked, and which were less effective.

Unfortunately, nothing like this existed. So I began working on what would later become **Fitlogger**.

This project is still in the early stages of development, with lots of new features in the pipe. I plan to add things like muscle-specific tracking, social elements, extended routines, and much, much more.

At this point, I am focusing all of my efforts on making the core elements of the project the best they can be. All the fluff doesn't matter if creating exercises and routines is cumbersome.

The best web and mobile applications always manage to achieve a good balance between simplicity and features. Too simple, and you don't account for enough use cases. Too feature rich, and the app becomes overly complicated.

The core functionality of Fitlogger is not perfect yet, but that's the goal.

When I first began Fitlogger, it was pretty spontaneous. There wasn't much planning. But as I worked on it, I began to see its potential.

Generally, I'm a stickler for pre-planning, but I was already in the code, and excited by the idea. While I don't regret riding the wave of enthusiasm, I believe strongly that projects should be thoroughly mapped out before any code is written. For that reason, I am now reverting back to a design phase to organize future development.

I am eager to seeing what Fitlogger can become.
