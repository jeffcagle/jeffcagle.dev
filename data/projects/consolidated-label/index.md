## My Responsibilities

> <cite>- Gregg Step | Marketing Manager</cite>

As the lead website developer for nearly a decade, I was responsible for everything from design and development, to server provisioning and deployment. I setup and managed multiple website instances and databases across testing and production servers, and kept their servers up to date and secure.

I also created custom admin tools for the content and marketing team and developed a modular, _component-like_, template system for rapid theme development.
