![Jeffcagle.dev Website Design](./jcd-main.jpg 'Gatsby Static Website - JeffCagle.dev')

## Why Gatsby

JAMStack (JavaScript, API and Markup) and static site generation seems to be all the rage these days. And for good reason. These websites are generally very fast, secure, lightweight, and easily deployed to CDN's around the world.

One of the industry leaders in static site generation is [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/ 'Gatsby.js'). Coupled with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/ 'GraphQL'), Gatsby is a powerful framework for creating modern static sites.

This was my first experience using GraphQL, and I love having the ability to control the shape of requested data. While this is less of an issue on my smaller site, I can certainly appreciate how helpful GraphQL queries could be on a larger, more complex, website.

I decided to host this site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ 'Netlify') for the simplicity with form handling and deployment via GitHub.

![Color Palette](./palette.jpg 'My Color Palette')

As a JavaScript developer, I wanted emphasize all things JavaScript on my site. To do this, my color pallette was designed around the yellow of the JavaScript brand. This would be my primary color. In order to make sure the yellow stood out, all complimentary colors needed to be on the cooler side of the color wheel.
